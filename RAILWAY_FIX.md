# Railway Deployment Fix

## 🔧 **Problem Fixed**
The deployment was failing due to heavy ML dependencies (PyTorch, CUDA libraries) that are too large for Railway's build environment.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**
1. **Created lightweight requirements** (`requirements-production.txt`) without ML dependencies
2. **Disabled ML components** in production mode
3. **Updated Dockerfile** to use lightweight requirements
4. **Added NODE_ENV=production** to startup command

## 🚀 **Railway Environment Variables**
Set these variables in your Railway dashboard:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8000
```

## 📋 **What Works in Production Mode**
- ✅ **Basic API endpoints** (`/api/health`, `/api/projects`, `/api/documents`)
- ✅ **Supabase database integration**
- ✅ **Document serving** (static files)
- ✅ **CORS configuration** for frontend
- ✅ **Environment configuration**

## 🔧 **What's Disabled in Production**
- ❌ **ML-powered chat features** (sentence transformers, embeddings)
- ❌ **Advanced AI analysis** (strategic agents, business intelligence)
- ❌ **Vector search** (requires chromadb)

## 🌟 **Next Steps**
1. **Deploy again** - Railway should build successfully now
2. **Test basic endpoints** - `/api/health` and `/api/projects` should work
3. **Deploy frontend** - Connect to your Railway backend URL
4. **Enable ML features later** - Can be added with more advanced deployment setup

## 🔮 **Future ML Deployment Options**
If you need ML features in production:
1. **Use Railway Pro** - Higher resource limits
2. **Deploy to Google Cloud Run** - Better for ML workloads
3. **Use AWS Lambda** - Serverless ML inference
4. **Separate ML service** - Deploy ML components separately

Your dashboard will be fully functional for project management, document viewing, and basic features!
