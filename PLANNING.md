Great, so this is how I want the supabase database to work. The following tables all need to be interconnected so we can create a front end project management dashboard that lists the projects.

When you click on a project it would show the associated tasks, meetings, project reports, and related documents. At the top of the page it would show the most recent project update.

Clients

Projects

Documents (Strategic_documents currently store the vector embeddings but I also want a table that lists the documents those embeddings are from with a link to the file and categorized as meeting transcript, SOP, project files, ect)

Tasks

Project Reports
